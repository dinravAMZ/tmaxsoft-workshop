# Getting Started


To start this workshop, make sure you have an AWS account to use services used in the lab exercises. Follow one of the following options:

#### :one: [Start the workshop in your own AWS Account.](/1_gettingstarted/01_self_paced.html), 

#### or

#### :two: [Start the workshop on an AWS hosted event](/1_gettingstarted/02_aws_event.html)
> ***using AWS provided hashes for the AWS EventEngine.***

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Infrastructure Provisioning Lab**](/20_infrastructure_provisioning_lab.html)
