# Infrastructure Provisioning & Setup

{{% notice info %}}
Note: This lab document is only for **Self Paced** infrastructure deployment, not to be performed if you are performing lab through _AWS Event Engine_.

{{% /notice %}}

## Learning Objectives

- Deploy Redhat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Pak for Data using CloudFormation template
- Infrastructure provisioning for Lab - 4.

<!-- -->
## Prerequisites
- IBM Cloud Pak for Data
- AWS Account

## Overview

This lab implements creating required infrastructure and loading data onto respective AWS resources.

## Lab Environment

### Step 1: AWS Resources used in this lab


#### AWS Cloud9
**AWS Cloud9** is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects. Since your Cloud9 IDE is cloud-based, you can work on your projects from your office, home, or anywhere using an internet-connected machine.

**How we made it different?**

In this cloud9 environment we have pre-installed with the required tools and utilities to access specific to our lab execution.

### Step 2: Cli Resources used in this lab
#### Openshift Cli
With the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI), the oc command, you can create applications and manage OpenShift Container Platform projects from a terminal. The **_OpenShift CLI_** is ideal in the following situations:

* Working directly with project source code

* Scripting OpenShift Container Platform operations

* Managing projects while restricted by bandwidth resources and the web console is unavailable

#### AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

### Step 3: Create Hosted Zone for your domain

Follow below steps to create Hosted Zone in AWS:

1. Search for the _Route 53_ service and click **Hosted zones** under **DNS Management**.

![](/images/00_getting_started/route_53_1.png?classes=shadow)

2. Click **Create hosted zone** to create a new hosted zone for your domain name.

        Note: If you already have domain registered with AWS, then you may skip this step.

3. Note down the newly created NS record.

![](/images/00_getting_started/route_53_3.png?classes=shadow)

4. Once after creating hosted zone in AWS. visit your domain name provider and update NS (Name Server) record created in step 3.

### Step 4: Red Hat OpenShift pull secret.

1. Visit https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret and follow instructions to get Red Hat pull secret for OpenShift. Download the pull secret (json) file and save it in the Amazon S3 bucket for further use.

### Step 5: Create the stack in CloudFormation on AWS Console.

Note: This lab is available only for 2 - 3 days.
{{% /notice %}}
  1. Login into AWS Console and search for _CloudFormation_ services and then click on **Create Stack** with new resources.

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_1.png?classes=shadow)

  2. Select template source as **Amazon S3** and provide the below s3 url for _Amazon S3 URL_

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_2.png?classes=shadow)

  ******
  https://ibm-aws-immersion-day.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/self-paced/templates/master.yml
  ******

  3. Provide the required inputs

  Specify stack name and availability zone as shown below

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_3.png?classes=shadow)

  Provide your domain name instead of _example.com_

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_4.png?classes=shadow)

  Provide password to login to Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Pak for Data

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_6.png?classes=shadow)

  Provide IBM Cloud Pak for Data API key which you might have received as the part of previous step.

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_7.png?classes=shadow)

  Provide Redhat pull secret that you saved in Amazon S3 in earlier step.

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/create_cfn_stack_8.png?classes=shadow)

  4. Choose **appropriate IAM Role** as shown below.

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/3_Screenshot.png?classes=shadow)

  5. Acknowledge and Click the **Create stack** button

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/4_Screenshot.png?classes=shadow)

  6. Review the outputs (stacks) formed in AWS CloudFormation tab.

  ![](/images/00_getting_started/resources.png?classes=shadow)

  {{% notice info %}}
  TIP: Since this is a master template we can view the resources as nested stacks.

  7. Review the output and Connect to the Cloud9 Environment.
  
  ![](/images/00_getting_started/cloud9.png?classes=shadow)

#### Access Cloud9 Environment through browser console and validate OpenShift and Cloud Pak for Data deployment.

1.  Check for the tools installation.

        oc version

    Output:

        ....
        Sample Output:
        .....
        Client Version: 4.9.23
        Server Version: 4.8.11
        Kubernetes Version: v1.21.1+9807387
        .....

    **aws** command

        aws


    Expected Output:

        usage: aws [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]
        To see help text, you can run:

          aws help
          aws <command> help
          aws <command> <subcommand> help

        aws: error: the following arguments are required: command

2.  Validate the aws secret key credentials.

        aws configure

    Output:

        AWS Access Key ID [****************HZH5]:
        AWS Secret Access Key [****************BBPW]:
        Default region name [us-east-2]:
        Default output format [json]:


3.  Connect to CP4D Cluster.

        export OCP_USER=ocsadmin
        export OCP_PASSWORD=ocsadmin
        export OCP_API=https://api.<clustername>.<domainname>:6443
        oc login --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true -u ${OCP_USER} -p ${OCP_PASSWORD} ${OCP_API}

    Expected Output:

        Login successful.

        You have access to 66 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

    **whoami** command

        oc whoami --show-console

    Expected Output:

        https://console-openshift-console.apps.<clustername>.<domainname>.com


4.  Get the route.

        oc get route |awk 'NR==2 {print $2}'

      Using the route, users will be able to login into CP4D using the above created credentials and start Lab exercises.


### Step 6: Low/No Code ML application deployment on Amazon EKS cluster

1. Login to AWS console and search for **CloudFormation** service and search for the **Stack** name which you have created in **step 5**.

3. Go to the **Output** section of the stack and then note down the value of **KeyPairName**.
![](/images/00_getting_started/eks-5.png?classes=shadow)

4. Go to **EC2** services home page, and from the **Network & Security** section of EC2 click on **Key Pairs** to find the **ID** of key pair. for example here the ID is key-07137bb589deb20af.

![](/images/00_getting_started/eks-6.png?classes=shadow)

5. Search for **System Manager** service

8. Create a pem file and paste the content in the pem file.

         vi ekskeypair.pem

    and change the permission

        chmod 400 ekskeypair.pem

9. Go to **EC2** service page and then search for **EKSBastion** instance

![](/images/00_getting_started/eks-1.png?classes=shadow)

![](/images/00_getting_started/eks-2.png?classes=shadow)


10. Connect to **EKSBastion** node with PEM_FILE and INSTANCE_IP. Here INSTANCE_IP is the public ip of bastion instance.

        ssh -i PEM_FILE.pem ec2-user@INSTANCE_IP

11. clone **ibm-aws-quickstart-immersionday** repo

        git clone https://github.com/ibm-aws/ibm-aws-quickstart-immersionday.git

12. deploy the application using below commands

   Go to project folder


           cd ibm-aws-quickstart-immersionday/

   then

           cd templates/config

   then
