## Analysis and Discovery Phase : <!-- MODIFY THIS HEADING -->

In this section, you will **import** the AWS CardDemo application artifacts into OFMiner source repositories, analyze and assess. You will use OFMiner to find missing source code objects, unsupported syntax (if any), source code compatibility with OpenFrame, etc.

**OFMiner** is a comprehensive **discovery and assessment tool**, which helps understanding the mainframe application portfolio, visualize the inventory metrics, component dependencies, complexity metrics and many more.
